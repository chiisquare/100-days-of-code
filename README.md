this is sort of an abbreviated diary of my coding journey, especially the first 100 days of it. i have restarted it at least 2-3 times, with the fourth time (the most recent one from Feb. 2023) being a continuation of the challenge since I didn't want to start from day 1 again, although in all appearances, it is a day 1.

there are many stretches where i don't code and just read about it, usually due to life circumstances but also because coding is tough work for someone who's not used to being self-guided! but that's okay. the journey alone is already worth it, and i can't wait to become someone who tolerates uncertainty and can organize her own systems for success.
