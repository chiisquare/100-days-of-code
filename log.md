**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Find the Longest Word in a String](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/find-the-longest-word-in-a-string)
2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence)
--->

### Day 1: January 23, 2022, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started FreeCodeCamp by learning basic HTML and HTML5.

**Thoughts**: Pretty straightforward, really liking the concise tutorials. Feels good to see myself applying what I've learned on really basic applications.

### Day 2: January 24, 2022, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic HTML tutorial and began learning CSS via FreeCodeCamp. Dad has generously purchased for me an Udemy course on Android app development using Kotlin. Enrolled in MIT Python course for Wednesday, Jan. 26th! (2/4/2022: have unenrolled since due to a desire to focus on easier languages or courses first. will definitely consider returning though)

**Thoughts**: I can think a lot more clearly now that I'm not super sleepy. My attention span still feels pulled in multiple directions. Took a really long break after lunch.... gonna get going on CSS and then look at the Udemy course on Kotlin. I'm hoping I don't bite off more than I can chew!

### Day 3: January 26, 2022 Wednesday (skipped Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Downloaded Android Studio on my Surface. Looked up UI stuff.

**Thoughts:** Pretty straightforward. I have high hopes for my course so far. I feel like I'm putting a lot of pressure on this for being something I plan to make money out of, but I just gotta stay in the moment and focus on taking it one step at a time.

### Day 4: January 27, 2022 Thursday

*Today's Progress*: tried to get AVD (android virtual device) working, it's basically an emulator.

**Thoughts:** slow progress. mostly worked on applying for jobs.

### Day 5: January 31, 2022, Monday (skipped Friday, Saturday, and Sunday afaik... restart challenge?)

**Today's Progress**: just did ~20 minutes of CSS on Free Code Camp. Looked up requirements for being a Senior Engine Engineer/Programmer at MiHoYo (since I'm an avid Genshin Impact player at the time of writing this).

**Thoughts:** I think I need to do things one at a time. Working on two languages at once is a lot for me right now.

### RESTART (goal: get a job as a front-end developer by Feb. 2023)

### Day 1: Feb. 3rd, 2022 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: attempted to create my first ever android app (that simply says 'hello world' in kotlin), looked up what CSS was, practiced modifying margins and padding in an existing HTML document using CSS in FreeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts:** this first app didn't display at all in my AVD (android virtual device), throttling my progress in the udemy course. will post question.

### Day 2: Feb. 4th, 2022 Friday

**Today's Progress**: completed the Basic CSS module of the Responsive Web Design Certification course on FreeCodeCamp (around 45% of it today) in roughly 2 hrs using pomodoro technique.

**Thoughts:** took many breaks but learned and accomplished a lot. Towards the latter third of the module, the challenges started getting hard enough to where I had to sift through some older tutorials to refresh what I've learned about classes and IDs. I don't remember the challenges being this difficult in my 8th grade (~2008) web development class! The challenges felt gratifying and not too hard though. I'm so impressed with the organization of these modules, the concise and diverse resources available in the webpage for people who get stuck, and that it's all completely FREE! I will for sure plan on donating to the website once I'm employed again. My neck hurts now - most likely I'll change my set up such that my Surface Pro is elevated. But I'm feeling pumped to go at it again tomorrow!

**Notes on what I've learned:**

- #womenintech, #womenwhocode
- learned about a free coding boot camp called "#100devs". super inspired by the community and availability of good quality and free resources that are out there. experiencing this encouraging atmosphere helps me stay motivated to pursue software development and programming after over a year of hesitance. joining #100daysofcode on twitter is a game-changer.

### Day 3: Feb. 5th, 2022 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Maxed out three stats on LearntoCodeRPG before restarting. Spent about a good hour or so doing that.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a bit frustrated and regretful that I was locked into ending the game and didn't have time to finish maxing out the other stats. I cheated a few times by looking up the answers to the CS questions as well. I am wondering how best to learn this information without having to just guess and remember it next time. Is there a place in freecodecamp where I can read about each language before taking the quiz? Going forward, I will save on a different slot before doing a significant action like apply for a job. Because once you apply for a job, you basically get locked into ending the game in a certain way. Save on another slot before you apply for that job.

### Day 4: Feb. 6th, 2022 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: spent roughly 3 hours maxing out all of my CS knowledge stats in Learn to Code RPG by freeCodeCamp! step 1 of the 2022 Become-a-Dev New Year's Challenge, complete!

**Thoughts:** i've been knocking the 30 minute rule out of the ballpark these past few days! often at the expense of another habit, but this is my main habit that i've chosen to implement, so i'm okay with this. i had a fun time unlocking achievements, taking time to re-read what i first read several months ago in nov or dec 2021 when i first downloaded and played this game.... i had a much harder time getting a job in the game now and began to have a good idea of how arduous and time-consuming the process was. i was surrounded by really kind and helpful people, and the overall tone of the game was very encouraging and grounding. i have a better understanding now of git, linux, javascript, and sql. i also appreciated how difficult the "technical interview" questions were compared to my studies. and that the game will let you get accepted if your stats are above a certain threshold. unlocking different achievements and endings was also really fun too. it really stimulated the competitive and goal/achievement-oriented side of myself. it's funny how hard i went at this considering how i was encouraging myself to take it easy a few days ago. i felt really embarrassed about myself last night, had trouble sleeping, and just felt motivated to prove myself or compensate in some way. not my intended motive, but at least i achieved a goal i'd set out to do. 

### Day 5: Feb. 9th, 2022 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: took two days as a break to adjust to onboarding at a new job. these days were spent with me reading through game dev notes on Learn to Code RPG from freeCodeCamp in my spare time and starting to download the necessary software needed for the Relational Database Curriculum (also from fCC).

**Thoughts:** I feel a little bit over my head.... I'm not entirely sure what languages like Bash are for, even after maxing out my stats in the coding RPG. but that's what the Internet is for, amirite?

### Day 6: Feb. 10th, 2022 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: spent about an hour or so finishing the set up of the aforementioned software (Docker, Git, Visual Studio Code, and an extension?) on my main computer and Surface before finally starting the tutorial. 

**Thoughts:** Let me tell you, it was a RIDE trying to set the curriculum up these past few days! Having to use the git CMD terminal, remembering how to operate said terminal (when it was sort of assumed in the instructions), getting my Visual Studio Code to recognize that I've configured my Git account on my Git software by restarting the software... not getting it to work then... and then restarting the whole computer, which made it work. Lots of googling, asking my developer dad (who is also my biological dad) for help, and getting frustrated. Is this the software developer experience? Meanwhile, the actual tutorial itself was much more straightforward. Learned about Bash, Git (cursory level), JSON, Docker, and terminals. Feeling a little in over my head right now, but that's okay.

### Day 7: Feb. 11th, 2022 Friday

**Today's Progress**: spent ~1.5 hrs finishing the first tutorial from fCC's relational database course, where I practiced using Bash on Visual Studio Code to build a boilerplate. Wrote some Anki cards regarding Bash.

**Thoughts:** I'm writing this three days later, so the details are a bit hazy. The boilerplate itself wasn't too difficult to build. A lot of it was confirming that my action actually worked. Feeling pretty productive.

### Day 8: Feb. 12th, 2022 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: booted up new tutorial on using SQL in PostgreSQL to create a Mario relational database.  

**Thoughts:** spent maybe 15 minutes on this since I had plans this weekend to spend time with a loved one. uneventful day. didn't count this as its own day due to minimal work actually being done.

### Day 8.5: Feb. 13th, 2022 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: started on steps 1 and 2 in said SQL tutorial, but had trouble connecting to the server in both steps despite performing them correctly and attempting to restart the terminal and programs. needed to sleep early to leave for home the next day, so after about 20 minutes or so of troubleshooting, I decided to call it a day. 

**Thoughts:** honestly was feeling quite frustrated that night. I can accept struggles on the coding itself, but when it has to do with mere set-up, I find it very irksome. I just feel like I'm wasting time at that point. Lol, yet again, is this simply part of being a developer?

### Day 9: Feb. 14th, 2022 Monday

**Today's Progress**: spent 30 minutes getting the SQL tutorial to work (had to do some googling, I wasn't the only one encountering problems with getting the tutorial to work apparently. i'm grateful that others have already asked the same question and that the solutions worked for me). spent another 4 hours or so with intermittent breaks (pomodoros = 30 min. now, breaks being 7 min. or more) attempting to finish the tutorial in one go. was on the last step before realizing that I performed the full join wrongly by misidentifying my junction table. proceeded to feel something of a mental breakdown before posting a hail mary question on fCC forum and calling it a day.

**Thoughts:** made a lot of progress, but my comprehension and retention of the actual material was definitely deteriorating. i look forward to combing through my notes and creating the anki cards tomorrow... maybe. if i can get myself to look at and attempt to fix the code. i'm half-resigned to the prospect of having to redo the entire tutorial in case it stops working tomorrow. this will sound dramatic, but i'm not sure i can bear to look at it now. my mind was giving me really intrusive thoughts and emotions about the weekend prior, which made my learning process that much more painful and difficult. went to bed feeling mildly anxious, ashamed, and drained.

### Day 10: Feb. 15th, 2022 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: someone responded to my fCC forum question clarifying that I hadn't done anything permanent, with the SELECT * FROM command, I was simply manipulating the way I was viewing the tables. with that, I submitted the true answer and officially completed the SQL Mario Database tutorial. I condensed my SQL notes on a single Google doc for me to reference later when creating my Anki cards. For now, I will take a break since yesterday ended up being pretty emotionally wrought for me. Loaded up the Celestial Bodies Database tutorial for tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Feeling relieved, grateful, and still a bit wiped from yesterday. I am usually pretty comfortable coding for awhile, but the pressure I was putting on myself yesterday, combined with having intrusive thoughts since I decided not to listen to music or meditate until much later made the process extremely difficult and painful for me. I followed a few new people on Twitter related to coding and supported some tweets that seemed to be less engaged with. I am now wondering if I can be somewhat invalidating in my responses sometimes. Again, may write Anki cards today, maybe not. Otherwise, I'm looking forward to coding again tomorrow.

### Day 11: Feb. 16th, 2022 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: spent ~1.5 hrs writing Anki cards on SQL before creating a separate google doc containing the assignment parameters for my Celestial Bodies Database project!

**Thoughts:** felt some intial resistance towards writing anki cards, but as soon as i sat down, i felt okay. also unconditionally took breaks during my assigned time after a pomodoro of 30 min., regardless of how much i actually worked during the pomo. building the database itself will be unguided, but i have my notes and anki cards from before to reference in case i feel lost. i'm looking forward to the challenge! and hope to spend at least an **hour** everyday from now on regarding code so I make more meaningful progress.

### Day 12: Feb. 18th, 2022 Friday

**Today's Progress**: actually started working on my celestial bodies database, attempted to save my work, posted a few questions on the fCC's thread for this curriculum, and took notes on the assignment rubric to make it a bit more condensed and understandable for me. 

**Thoughts:** felt less anxiety about this assignment as I read through the rubric and worked on the opening steps. I discovered that there's a dedicated thread on the fCC forums for this curriculum, rejoiced, and proceeded to ask a few questions in the form of one lengthy post. bless the soul of the person(s) who helps me out. lol. i may actually draw out my tables to use as a visual reference for myself instead of having to read the list every time to determine my progress and direction. i'm looking forward to learning some SQL & astronomy here!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1494922534151720961

### Day 13: Feb. 20th, 2022 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: i got an answer on fCC, wrote another question, organized my notes on the rubric into something with subheadings for each table, and then attempted to write out the data I plan to include in each table. i haven't even written more code yet.

**Thoughts:** had to skip programming practice yesterday since i was feeling really uncomfortable and emotional about several people in my life and my place in their relationships... i felt better after getting some sleep and going out to climb with friends. only started drawing out galaxy table in my journal bc i want to make sure that i have data for all of my categories (bc i'm certain there are smaller galaxies or celestial bodies that may not even have as much data as other bodies)... while correctness of data is not part of the rubric, i don't want to make numbers up. posted another question on fCC.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1495615786282586117

### Day 14: Feb. 25th, 2022 Friday

**Today's Progress**: continued to look up data to fill my database with. reviewed my notes from the previous SQL module, particularly regarding data types.

**Thoughts:** oops on skipping so many days in a row. Also, I'm writing this entry on 3/12/22, which was my 18th day of coding for this challenge. 4 days of coding in the span of 15 days... Job training has been more stressful than I bargained for.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1497402271579217922

### Day 15: Feb. 26th, 2022 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: started researching data for second table in celestial bodies database.

**Thoughts:** re-examined the requirements and realized that i may have been overthinking things regarding foreign keys.... unsure. am impatient.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1497430528877903872

### Day 16: Mar. 7th, 2022 Monday

**Today's Progress**: ...didn't truly do coding lol, only thought about it and found an article that would guide me with making a wordle clone using basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and NPM!

**Thoughts:** job training is finally easing up. I am so anxious that it's hard for me to do work outside of the shift.... current me (which is Mar. 12th chiisquare) is wondering if making time for yoga would have helped things... unsure.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1501019133260931074

### Day 17: Mar. 10th, 2022 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: started learning JavaScript through grasshopper, a free-to-use web and mobile application from Google that teaches people how to code! 

**Thoughts:** grasshopper is such an elegant and visually pleasing application to use. It reminds me a lot of freecodeCamp, actually. I have also registered for Kick Start, a Google coding competition, as well as cs50 Puzzle Day 2022! It was actually my teammate for Puzzle Day was the one who recommended grasshopper to me. I am very grateful to them!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1502076488341934094

### Day 18: Mar. 12th, 2022 Monday

**Today's Progress**: finished the first Coding Fundamentals module in grasshopper and received my first coding-related certificate of completion! I've gotta admit, it feels really good.

**Thoughts:** This module isn't difficult. In fact, I wonder if it's too easy. It was a good review of the basic concepts though while teaching me things about JavaScript. I feel like my many attempts to learn simple Python have benefited here. I'm looking forward to going deeper with grasshopper. Who knows? Maybe I'll use JavaScript for the coding competition!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1502784022090600450

### Day 19: Mar. 13th, 2022 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: began grasshopper's Fundamentals II module in earnest. Learned about .length, global and local variables, ternary operators, new ways to increment and decrement a value, print() vs console.log(), function declarations, return statement, .replace(oldPart, newPart), and recursion.

**Thoughts:** ...honestly I'm not entirely sure how much I've retained. I endeavored to list out the new topics I've learned so I can test my memory and look up what I don't understand. Also spent more time reading through the starter code (a.k.a. documentation?) before reading and following the instructions blindly, so I actually understand the code and what I'm doing to it. Installed the WakaTime chrome extension because I'm tired of it not logging my hours.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1503204192332230658

### Day 20: Mar. 14th, 2022 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Spent an hour going through recursion and more methods of JS via Google's grasshopper app!

**Thoughts:** Was frequently distracted by the amazing music I was listening to, haha.... I feel like I'm on cloud 9 since having completed a long session at work today, and I feel like I've done a good job. We'll see if my superior gets tired of me asking questions lol.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1503567261176631301

### Day 21: Mar. 16th, 2022 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: completed Grasshopper's Fundamental II module and began Intro to Interviewing

**Thoughts:** so far, so good. I am able to understand things a lot more quickly and easily when I'm emotionally sober lol. 

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1503911367002234888

### Day 22: Mar. 18th, 2022 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: asked questions about truthiness and falsiness in JS on Twitter on 3/16. found an article about said topic on 3/17. continued the Intro to Interviewing module in earnest today, attended a small, free Intro to Python workshop through the Healthy Gamer Discprd server.

**Thoughts:** am slow-going when it comes to working on coding... would like to get to a point where I'm working on coding at least 2 hours a day, but babysteps. RSVP'd to a virtual Tech Talk through my local Women Who Code Meetup group! I'm really excited about it. I'm getting more involved with the coding community and feel myself becoming more motivated!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1506010440152887300

### Day 23: Mar. 20th, 2022 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: continued the Intro to Interviewing module from Grasshopper. Learned about accessing strings similar to how we can index from arrays in JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** very slow progress... was very distracted. Most likely unused to the set up at my loved one's place. I'm a spoiled worker!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1506011310751989760

### Day 24: Mar. 21st, 2022 Monday

**Today's Progress**: started reading "How to Learn Programming" article on fCC (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-programming/amp/), downloaded Vim, and learned how to add properties to an object using bracket notation in JavaScript

**Thoughts:** was feeling a bit fatigued and wanted to call it quits earlier to get a headstart on preparing for bed. I have a habit of staying up to try and "get ahead" at a certain skill or task with little to no result... so I'm just going to establish a curfew for myself. Sleep is essential!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1506112742708625413

### Day 25: Mar. 22nd, 2022 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: practiced using Vim via vim tutor (am 75% done with it) and looked up what Linux was.

**Thoughts:** vim is pretty interesting so far! it is still unclear to me how and when I will use vim, but I'm happy I get to learn something that's so popular and important. May touch JavaScript so I don't lose my streak on Grasshopper. I was supposed to attend a PyLadies event today, but when I tried to participate by joining the call, no one else would let me in the room... either the link was faulty, or the event fell through. Next time!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1506450755930271755

### Day 26: Mar. 24th, 2022 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: finished vim tutor! 

**Thoughts:** the last 25% was considerably less straightforward than the previous steps... 7.2 specifically suddenly seemed like it was missing a lot more explanation for me to create my vimrc file, but after some tinkering and consulting with my programming dad, it worked out! this in itself took 1 hr for me, lol. i feel a bit embarrassed since the article that suggested vim tutor to me estimated it would take around 30 minutes (as opposed to 2 hours), but you know what? it's cool. i'm a slow learner, i have accepted this about myself.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1507090477778145284

### Day 27: Mar. 26th, 2022 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: continued the Intro to Interviewing module using JavaScript on Grasshopper.

**Thoughts:** feeling really distracted lately. Lost precious sleep yesterday since I let myself get addicted to an anime. While I felt much better today since I had no work today and could sleep in, I still felt really distracted. When I sit down to code, I am suddenly buffeted with several other things I could be doing for pseudoproductivity - like cleaning, learning to crochet, or studying a new language (to be completely frank though, I just wanted to continue watching Vanitas no Carte). While these other interests are good, I need to make a habit of blocking out my time so I can still have fun while getting the most important things done.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1507930161366417411

### Day 28: Mar. 27th, 2022 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: continued the Intro to Interviewing module using JavaScript on Grasshopper.

**Thoughts:** can't remember what I learned tbh, as I write this on Apr. 12th. shame on me.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1508297992914313216

### Day 29: Mar. 29th, 2022 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: continued the Intro to Interviewing module using JavaScript on Grasshopper.

**Thoughts:** finally entered the last submodule on the Interviewing module! am excited to learn how to break down solving a former Google interview question.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1508993943681257473

### Day 30: Apr. 1st, 2022 Friday

**Today's Progress**: continued the Intro to Interviewing module using JavaScript on Grasshopper. cs50x's Puzzle Day 2022 has begun!

**Thoughts:** not sure what I learned here, but I think I was learning how to build each of the specific functions necessary to solve the question after creating a mental model of the problem and its solution (i.e. abstraction). am struggling with retention and independent regurgitation! meanwhile

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1510109048758284291

### Day 31: Apr. 8th, 2022 Friday (late at night)

**Today's Progress**: (prior to today) completed cs50x's Puzzle Day 2022 with flying colors. fell ill, then continued the Intro to Interviewing module using JavaScript on Grasshopper after recovering. 

**Thoughts:** am struggling with certain quiz questions and why certain answers aren't as valid as the best answer. I am happy that I included others in my journey though; it was fun, heartwarming, and inspiring to receive generous help from people more experienced than me. thanks, all!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1512656883429093378

### Day 32: Apr. 9th, 2022 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: finally completed the Intro to Interviewing module on Grasshopper. at long last.

**Thoughts:** this session went more smoothly than the prior ones. I think the questions that were asked were a lot simpler and straightforward than the ones prior. I also was less emotionally invested in the music I was listening to and was probably more well-rested overall, haha.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1512977890975133700

### Day 33: Apr. 11th, 2022 Monday

**Today's Progress**: attended a remote Women Who Code hangout event for my city! could only feel comfortable with staying there partially, but I felt humbled and inspired to redouble my efforts into learning code.

**Thoughts:** Changed plans from working on the wordle clone (which I abandoned after having difficulty installing the current version of npm with node.js) to working on The Odin Project, which is deemed to be more useful and educational than freeCodeCamp (I still enjoy the latter, but I feel that TOP teaches more necessary real world skills earlier on). I may work on both together, with a primary focus on TOP.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1514073213193662464

### Day 34: Apr. 12th, 2022 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: read an article recommended by an introductory TOP lesson on procrastination and felt both called out and seen. drew out an Eisenhower matrix sorting out the ways I want to spend my time. resolved to meditate everyday for at least 15 minutes to encourage self-awareness and intentionality..

**Thoughts:** not exactly coding-related, but I think said article has forced me to reevaluate how I spend my time from a more honest and empathetic point of view... I feel like I've let my Instant Gratification Monkey run most of my life! It is a sobering realization. In a way though, it is a cognitively "simpler" way to live but it comes at a high cost: physically, emotionally, financially, and spiritually. I feel that I am reminded of the significance of regular meditation, which helps us become more aware (and neutral) of the impulse to avoid tedious yet significant work. 

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1514076496360620036

### Day 35: Apr. 14th, 2022 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: started the "Learning How to Learn" course on Coursera yesterday and really enjoyed it.... a lot of the practical tips were said to me several times before, but not on a neuroscience level. I really appreciated learning about the importance of focused and diffused modes of thinking. Today on LH2L, I listened to more interviews from people in different disciplines share their thoughts and approaches on learning. I then spent about an hour reading about I can ask for help or troubleshoot effectively on The Odin Project, and then had the opportunity to speak with UI/UX designer. 

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed the LH2L course so far still. I feel a bit guilty for this sidequest since I'm not actively coding, but I think it's important to take a step back and look at the bigger picture: what is my why? what coding languages do job opportunities at my preferred city of residence tend to require? how am I approaching learning at this time that is actually holding me back from meaningful achievement? I then felt a bit impatient with the TOP submodule because, although it was easy, I was anxious to just start learning how to code. Speaking with the UI/UX designer was really humbling... I appreciate the job more deeply as a result. I feel unsure of my ability to connect with people in the capacity that will be required for me in that job, but I do feel encouraged to learn more about other tech jobs, so I know for sure that I'm not just defaulting to software development because it's the cool thing to do.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1514800031529799689

### Day 36: Apr. 15th, 2022 Friday

**Today's Progress**: finished the assignment on asking questions well and best practices when dealing with help vampires on The Odin Project. Linked my github account to my Discord account (we're getting sErIoUs up here...!) and then read some more guidelines on how to answer other people's questions well. This all took about 50 minutes for me, no breaks (other than when I was zoning out while fidgeting with a Rubik's cube).

**Thoughts:** lots of reading (subjectively speaking). I'm not used to reading a single thing for a long period of time. Plus I'm doing this late at night, when I'm relatively sleepy and frankly kind of mad/anxious at myself for waiting this long to work when I could have been productive for a longer period of time. Will try to sleep early and maybe get up at a reasonable hour in the morning to get some learning out of the way?

### Day 37: Apr. 17th, 2022 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Happy Easter 2022! Completed half of the TOP assignment on learning how the web functions. Also learned more about how DuckDuckGo, a search engine and mobile web browser, compares with other search engines like Google, VPNs, incognito browsing, and if SEO practices would change based on which search engine you're using (spoiler alert: it probably does, but since so many people use Google, which also has very accurate search engine indices and algorithms, I surmise that it's usually more valuable to cater SEO to Google). 

**Thoughts:** Spent about 3 pomodoros (25 min. each) on this. I started this late evening, actually skipped dinner because I was so engrossed, and found myself getting carried away with my thoughts, often. While not much was accomplished, I find myself feeling very curious and thoughtful about the topics I was reading since I am was and am close to people who are very concerned about their online privacy. While I deprived myself of sleep last night, forcing myself to take a 2-3 hour nap after lunch really helped me feel more energized and composed. I have a day off from work tomorrow and plan to spend a portion of my morning at a local cafe to see how a change in scenery will serve me. It will be my reward for sleeping and rising earlier!

### Day 38: Apr. 19th, 2022 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: learned more about how the web works and started on week 2 of #LH2L. 

**Thoughts:** Taking things nice and slowly. Not really much to say here. I'm enjoying learning more about how the web works though. It feels empowering to learn more about tools that I use so frequently.

### Day 39: Apr. 20th, 2022 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: preparing my Surface to install Ubuntu as a dual-boot.

**Thoughts:** The instructions are quite straightforward, but I keep running into hurdles and various contradicting guides that force me to backtrack and re-examine some things... I racked my brains over what partition file system I should use since my USB was using a different type than my Surface was (in the end, I just needed to choose the file system that my Surface was on, which is the system which will run my OS), had to disable Secure Boot on my Surface, then Bitlocker, and THEN clear some files from my Surface to ensure that I had plenty of space to do all that I wanted to do with Ubuntu... I think tomorrow will be the trick!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1516972081455550465

### Day 40: Apr. 21st, 2022 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: FINALLY INSTALLED UBUNTU! PHEW-EE!!!!!

**Thoughts:** This was a PROCESS. I was feeling so stressed when I had to spend time shrinking/resizing a certain amount of space on my hard drive using AOMI to set aside just for Ubuntu as I was following this guide on Medium, but things got complicated quickly afterwards and I ended up following the instructions incorrectly by just letting the install wizard set up the file partiions for me instead of setting them up myself, haha. Not to mention the nightmare that was me trying to move some files away from my Surface; there was a HUGE amount of files that were projected to take 10+ hours to move to my external storage device, but they were actually just from my OneDrive.... lol. Also, I was today years old when I learned that if you put things in your Recycle Bin, they don't actually get cleared out until you specifically empty your Bin... My Surface is 10+ GB freer now, homies. 

Also spent hella time trying to figure out how to get my monitors to display properly. My Surface runs slower when I use fractional scaling, but it's okay. I can accept this fact as long as things aren't freakishly magnified or minified on either monitor. Thank you, Google and peeps. After much time and agonizing... I am now part of the Ubuntu family. <3

### Day 41: Apr. 24th, 2022 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: spent two days installing VSCode, learning about the CLI, and setting up Git. 

**Thoughts:** keeping things low-key and chill. Also, I suddenly remember that I have an embroidery project I'd like to finish... this is what happens when I don't time block!!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1518399325239394310

### Day 42: Apr. 25th, 2022 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: learned more about Git and GitHub. Spent some time watching videos from week 2 on LH2L.

**Thoughts:** Took an incredibly refreshing walk earlier today and felt energized to learn. I'm also making myself take more breaks as I use pomodoro when I used to skip them.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1519144257579372545

### Day 43: Apr. 26th, 2022 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  practiced basic Git commands as well as the two-step commit process. Created my first repo. 🙂 Was introduced to HTML and CSS. Began making an HTML boilerplate.

**Thoughts:** Creating my first repo was super fun! I finally understand the crux of what's happening when I use Git and GitHub now... it feels like I've unlocked a part of my programming world map to explore. Now, when I see people mention these keywords in the tech part of social media, I feel less intimidated and out-of-my-depth. I feel motivated to continue! (In other news, I've been finding myself becoming less attentive during work and nearly overslept for my shift today! I have printed out a two week sleep diary to really get a handle on my habits. And with that, I will stop for today and endeavor to finish my embroidery project!)

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1519485485575544835

### Day 44: May 4th, 2022 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  practiced building my HTML boilerplate from memory and learned from the LH2L MOOC about about more efficient ways to ingrain a concept into memory.

**Thoughts:** am mostly focusing on the MOOC. the HTML assignment was pretty straightforward.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1522044685056974848

### Day 45: May 5th, 2022 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: spent time learning more basic HTML elements and completed week 3 of #LH2L. I am almost done with the latter course, actually, and am looking forward to starting the related, more career-oriented course on Coursera soon! I wish I had done LH2L sooner!

**Thoughts:** ran into an issue where I could not modify my files after opening them on VSC and discovered with the help of a friend that I may have enabled Vim mode by accident. I have disabled the associated extension and can now use VSC normally!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1522439645019127811

### Day 46: May 6th, 2022 Friday

**Today's Progress**: made a simple HTML list within a pomodoro. Tomorrow I will learn to create HTML links and insert images.

**Thoughts:** Took my sweet time doing this, but I had fun. Took a moment for me to recall how to make lists.

**Link to work:** https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FS0jiOVXoAA8hb9?format=jpg&name=large

### Day 47: May 8th, 2022 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: began learning about absolute and relative HTML links and started the MindShift MOOC.

**Thoughts:** Not much was achieved this past weekend due to personal life updates, but I look forward to doubling down these next several weeks! Gotta stay healthy.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1523510837897572352

### Day 48: May 9th, 2022 Monday

**Today's Progress**: learned how to insert images as well as alt attributes, file organization, and practiced w/ relative links.

**Thoughts:** Was inadvertently tested on moving files across cousin folders w/ CLI. I am now two assignments away from working on my first project in #TheOdinProject!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1523843851491938304

### Day 49: May 10th, 2022 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: learned some best practices on writing effective Git commit messages. 

**Thoughts:** Still unsure how to write multi-line Git commit messages, but... tomorrow, I will embark on my first project that I will upload to my GitHub. I'm so excited!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1524231625571291136

### Day 50: May 11th, 2022 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed and pushed my first true project onto GitHub. I am feeling over the moon right now. 

**Thoughts:** This took maybe 3-4 hours for me, maybe more as I was trying to make this as flawless as possible. It is not a complicated project as it is simply an HTML page that links to three separate pages, but I really found myself confused on how to commit messages on VSC initially since I forgot that I had already set that connection up as well as getting invested in the descriptions for each recipe. I am still unsure how to write multiline Git commit messages. It also took me a strange amount of time getting my HTML link to display for users to return to the home page without having to hit the back button as well as learn a little markdown, but I am really happy and proud of my result, even after looking at other people's work. I worked hard on tihs project, learned a lot, and perhaps most of all, had fun. All in all, this was a momentous way to complete my halfway point for this coding challenge!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/chiisquare/odin-recipes

### Day 51: May 15th, 2022 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I read about basic CSS concepts from #TheOdinProject such as class and ID attributes as well as different types of selectors and how they can be utilized.

**Thoughts:** losing steam but I'm back on track for now!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1527104003393323008?t=xBwVgCSKNBJ2UMBPNPGawQ&s=19

### Day 52: May 23rd, 2022 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I read more about basic CSS and started learning about the cascade. I'm still not totally sure what that is...

**Thoughts:** n/a

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1528589179759763457?t=zrtMAwYEh38u5t4_g7jnlQ&s=19

### Day 53: July 20th, 2022 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Read several pages of Code Simplicity by @mkanat for an hour.

**Thoughts:** On vacation overseas with no laptop. Just returned to the world of studying after nearly two months of break... ish. I was busy packing for the trip and coordinating my leave from my job during my hiatus. Will try to make time to read further during my trip overseas, but no promises! here

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1528589179759763457?t=7IneJYg09eqfFhUzDBVCnQ&s=19

### Day 54: August 3rd, 2022 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent approximately 100 minutes reading the entire page on CSS fundamentals from The Odin Project.

**Thoughts:** While this took some considerable effort to get started on and to digest, this was a much smoother work period overall than the multiple attempts I took prior to taking my trip. I think the combination of (1) being unemployed, (2) having taken an extended break beforehand, and (3) working from a comfortable, private place provided me the mental calm and clarity to adequately understand and finish reading this lesson in one day. I am unsure how productive I will be in the coming days, but I aim to at least spend an hour each day... We will see how that goes. 

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1554954413713899521

### Day 55: August 9th, 2022 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed all of the exercises and the knowledge check from the beefy CSS Foundations lesson from TOP in ~2 hrs.

**Thoughts:** Made myself review some terminal and git commands in the midst of working on these exercises. This assignment was fun and straightforward.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1557113211110957066

### Day 56: August 11th, 2022 Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Familiarized myself with Chrome Dev Tools by inspecting several elements in a DOM and read more about the cascade of CSS.

**Thoughts:** Studied with a friend and was actually productive. Also, this lesson is surprisingly more time-consuming than I had thought it would be. Perhaps I am overbooking myself this week. 

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1557485320001699848

### Day 57: August 16th, 2022 Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** finished reading the MDN web doc page on the CSS box model.

**Thoughts:** was struggling to keep my mind focused on the topic, but found more improvement after consuming some caffeine and jotting down some key ideas as i was reading. <3

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1559653360252452865

### Day 58: August 27th, 2022 Saturday

**Today's Progress:** finished the entire TOP page (including assignment and knowledge check) on the CSS box model!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Thoughts:** I fought through a sleep-deprived mind to study with my friend at the local coffee shop, and the whole session ended up being much more enjoyable and productive than I had anticipated. so thankful for my IRL friends!

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1564019477326471169

### Day 59: August 30th, 2022 Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Began learning about "normal flow" in CSS layouts after going slightly more in-depth regarding block vs. inline vs. inline-block elements.

**Thoughts:** Had very poor sleep the night prior and was battling a headache, but felt significantly better after doing a ten minute yoga session with Adriene for beginners and showering. my concentration and calm aren't optimal right now, but I'm proud of myself for doing the most of what I could while respecting my limits.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1564807597106102272

### Day 60: September 1st, 2022 Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Finished reading the MDN doc on normal flow, the w3 article on inline vs. block elements, and digitalocean's visual guide to differentiating between inline-block elements vs. inline elements or even just block!

**Thoughts:** Took around 45 minutes to complete after like a 30 minute break in-between lol. I am very sleepy right now. 

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1565526067288350724

### Day 61: September 2nd, 2022 Friday 

**Today's Progress:** Completed 1 out of 2 exercises on modifying CSS margins and padding while studying with friends.

**Thoughts:** Had a fun time studying with friends but found myself getting increasingly frustrated with using my Surface's trackpad to look between different windows or Chrome tabs to complete the exercise. I have gotten so used to having two monitors and a separate mouse while using my Surface! Hopefully by bringing my own mouse, I will have an easier time navigating my Surface.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1566528844558991362

### Day 62: October 4th, 2022 Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Spent 50 minutes completing the Computer Basics lesson from TOP's Foundation course.

**Thoughts:** Very straightforward, but it was a valuable review.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1577490434300948480

### Day 63: February 19th, 2023 Sunday

**Today's Progress:** resumed this challenge for the umpteenth time! it seems that as my sleep schedule and sense of purpose declines, my desire to work towards something increases.... and for now, I have rechosen code again. I am working through freecodecamp's (New) Responsive Web Design certification and have read more of @ossia's book on learning to code and becoming a developer. I have made my fCC profile public,

**Thoughts:** I wish the book's background has a dark mode setting to make it easier on the eyes while reading. The new layout for the responsive web design certification is even more fluid than before somehow. I have a burgeoning belly. I wish I had my mouse with me as I work on my Microsoft Surface rather than this touchpad. It is late, and I feel sleepy and yet not sleepy at the same time. Very distracted.

**Link to work:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app/step-9

### Day 64: February 20th, 2023 Monday

**Today's Progress:** read more of @ossia's book on tips for breaking into tech as a self-taught software engineer.

**Thoughts:** too tired and sleepy to actually learn to code. i was literally reading as much as i could in my bed. i really wish fCC had a dark mode for this part of the site....

**Link to work:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/

### Day 65: February 21st, 2023 Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** made headway on my HTML cat photo app in fCC's newly revamped Responsive Web Design certification course

**Thoughts:** pretty straightforward stuff. got war flashbacks when I saw the term "inline elements." CSS.....

**Link to work:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app/step-45

### Day 66: February 22nd, 2023 Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** completed my HTML cat photo app using fCC's new tutorial in two pomodoros (about one hour)

**Thoughts:** I am appreciating the greater inclusion of CSS ideas in this tutorial. It feels very efficient and not overwhelming. I'm also glad that I finished this tutorial relatively quickly. Any slower, and I would have begun to forget essential, basic things.

**Link to work:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu/step-1

### Day 67: February 23rd, 2023 Thursday

**Today's Progress:** began learning basic CSS to build a cafe menu

**Thoughts:** really impressed with how well they've integrated basic concepts of CSS. i feel like TOP tends to information frontload first before you do stuff, but here, they minimize the overload by having you use bits of information as you go. things come to me more seamlessly as a result, and i'm spending less time staring at the screen, trying to organize the information in a way that makes sense to me and will stick in my brain.

**Link to work:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu/step-39

### Day 68: February 24th, 2023 Friday

**Today's Progress:** continued building my basic cafe menu with CSS and HTML, guided by fCC

**Thoughts:** this pomodoro took me forever to finish as i felt more inclined to reach out to my sister(s), etc. and dwell about future purchases and music. i think i just need a nap at this point.

**Link to work:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu/step-74

### Day 70: March 5th, 2023 Sunday

**Today's Progress:** learned more about using colors via CSS with fCC's colored markers tutorial

**Thoughts:** pretty straightforward stuff. color theory is interesting. am wondering what I should build as following a tutorial isn't exactly striking inspiration in me. mainly though, i am content that i have returned to learning coding again. suffering or the desire to prevent future suffering seems to be the best motivation for me, haha. i have been wondering a lot what my purpose is in life....

**Link to work:** https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-css-colors-by-building-a-set-of-colored-markers/step-36

### Day 71: May 8th, 2023 Monday

**Today's Progress:** played more with CSS to create color selectors with fCC. finished ossia's free book on breaking into tech the other day.

**Thoughts:** was motivated to come back here when a few people (in real life and online!) showed appreciation for me, and said that they were rooting for me!!! i have to hold onto those moments of support, especially for when i don't feel motivated to cheer for myself sometimes..... i believe in myself and in a world where everyone can win.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1655758603255443457

### Day 72: May 19th, 2023 Friday

**Today's Progress:** spent time refining my color selectors using CSS and HTML, about 50 minutes.

**Thoughts:** I don't feel 100% about the concepts. Merely staying present with the learning process today has been a struggle, as thoughts of work rise to the surface. I am even having difficulty sleeping becaues of work (again, my work is not coding-related. Maybe I need to take a day off soon?)

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1659743884992212993

### Day 73: May 20th, 2023 Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Progressed towards finishing the CSS color selectors exercise on fCC

**Thoughts:** focus was better this session than before, but not optimal. learned about designing and customizing borders and shadows around elements

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1660052232094601217

### Day 74: May 24th, 2023 Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** completed the color selectors exercise for CSS and began building an HTML form on fCC

**Thoughts:** progress seems much more smooth and effortless this morning. reviewed some things about HTML elements now that a training wheel seems to have been removed in these tutorials. 

may move study sessions to the morning. will also consider purchasing my own surface charger and switching internet providers since the current one is fast, but sometimes unstable, especially in the evenings

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1661351462490845184

### Day 75: May 27th, 2023 Saturday

**Today's Progress:** switched default browsers to Firefox on Ubuntu due to problems rendering sites and certain dropdown menus on Chrome, despite fully updating both Windows and Ubuntu programs on my Surface. Enabled Ubuntu Pro and LivePatch. Made headway in my HTML registration form on fCC.

**Thoughts:** Lots of tearing my hair out, figuratively speaking. I was so close to updating my graphics drivers manually until I found a more conservative, safer solution, which mostly worked..... and then realized from a thread that Firefox can render certain things better than Chrome, specifically due to Java stuff? Not sure yet. It was a fun challenge though.

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1662661045209509888

### Day 76: May 28th, 2023 Sunday

**Today's Progress:** inching along in my registration form HTML project in fCC.

**Thoughts:** felt distracted... happy with my new work set up that my partner and I planned together, but am feeling concerned about other things....

**Link to work:** https://twitter.com/chiisana2u/status/1663317783382302721

### Day 77: May 31st, 2023 Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** completed the skeleton of my registration form using HTML. began using CSS to improve the appearance.

**Thoughts:** only spent 30 minutes studying today due to sleepiness. was a good push though.
