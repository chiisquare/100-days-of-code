### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: January 23, 2022, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started FreeCodeCamp by learning basic HTML and HTML5.

**Thoughts**: Pretty straightforward, really liking the concise tutorials. Feels good to see myself applying what I've learned on really basic applications.

### Day 2: January 24, 2022, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic HTML tutorial and began learning CSS via FreeCodeCamp. Dad has generously purchased for me an Udemy course on Android app development using Kotlin. Enrolled in MIT Python course for Wednesday, Jan. 26th! (2/4/2022: have unenrolled since due to a desire to focus on easier languages or courses first. will definitely consider returning though)

**Thoughts**: I can think a lot more clearly now that I'm not super sleepy. My attention span feels pulled in multiple directions though. Took a really long break after lunch.... gonna get going on CSS and then look at the Udemy course on Kotlin. I'm hoping I don't bite off more than I can chew!

### Day 3: January 26, 2022 Wednesday (skipped Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Downloaded Android Studio on my Surface. Looked up UI stuff.

**Thoughts:** Pretty straightforward. I have high hopes for my course so far. I feel like I'm putting a lot of pressure on this being something I'll make money out of, but I just gotta stay in the moment and focus on taking it one step at a time.

### Day 4: January 27, 2022 Thursday

*Today's Progress**: tried to get AVD (android virtual device) working, it's basically an emulator.

**Thoughts:** slow progress. mostly worked on applying for jobs.

### Day 5: January 31, 2022, Monday (skipped Friday, Saturday, and Sunday afaik... restart challenge?)

**Today's Progress**: just did ~20 minutes of CSS on Free Code Camp. Looked up requirements for being a Senior Engine Engineer/Programmer at MiHoYo (since I'm an avid Genshin Impact player).

**Thoughts:** I think I need to do things one at a time. Working on two languages at once is a lot for me right now.

RESTART (goal: get a job as a front-end developer by Feb. 2023)

### Day 1: Feb. 3rd, 2022 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: attempted to create my first ever android app (that simply says 'hello world' in kotlin), looked up what CSS was, practiced modifying margins and padding in an existing HTML document using CSS in FreeCodeCamp.org

**Thoughts:** this first app didn't display at all in my AVD (android virtual device), throttling my progress in the udemy course. will post question.

### Day 2: Feb. 4th, 2022 Friday

**Today's Progress**: completed the Basic CSS module of the Responsive Web Design Certification course on FreeCodeCamp (around 45% of it today) in roughly 2 hrs using pomodoro technique.

**Thoughts:** took many breaks but learned and accomplished a lot. Towards the latter third of the module, the challenges started getting hard enough to where I had to sift through some older tutorials to refresh what I've learned about classes and IDs. I don't remember the challenges being this difficult in my 8th grade (~2008) web development class! The challenges felt gratifying and not too hard though. I'm so impressed with the organization of these modules, the concise and diverse resources available in the webpage for people who get stuck, and that it's all completely FREE! I will for sure plan on donating to the website once I'm employed again. My neck hurts now - most likely I'll change my set up such that my Surface Pro is elevated. But I'm feeling pumped to go at it again tomorrow!

**Notes on what I've learned:**

- CSS override priorities: !important > inline style > id declarations > class declarations (if just conflicting class declarations, they are prioritized by order)
- CSS is its own language and can be used alongside HTML or XHTML to create and design webpages. "Advantages of CSS CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want."
- hexcode and RGB values are two ways to represent colors.
- CSS variables are a way to change many CSS style properties at once by changing only a single value (ex: --penguin-skin: gray;)
- CSS variables can be inherited... by defining :root in the style section of a webpage. not entirely sure how this works tbh.
- "The CSS Media Query gives you a way to apply CSS only when the browser and device environment matches a rule that you specify, for example "viewport is wider than 480 pixels". Media queries are a key part of responsive web design, as they allow you to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport, but they can also be used to detect other things about the environment your site is running on, for example whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse."
- #womenintech, #womenwhocode
- learned about a free coding boot camp called "#100devs". super inspired by the community and availability of good quality and free resources that are out there. experiencing this encouraging atmosphere helps me stay motivated to pursue software development and programming after over a year of hesitance. joining #100daysofcode on twitter is a game-changer.

### Day 3: Feb. 5th, 2022 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Maxed out three stats on LearntoCodeRPG before restarting. Spent about a good hour or so doing that.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a bit frustrated and regretful that I was locked into ending the game and didn't have time to finish maxing out the other stats. I cheated a few times by looking up the answers as well. I am wondering how best to learn this information without having to just guess and remember it next time. Is there a place in freecodecamp where I can read about each language before taking the quiz? Going forward, I will save on a different slot before doing a significant action like apply for a job. Because once you apply for a job, you basically get locked into ending the game in a certain way. Save on another slot before you apply for that job.

### Day 4: Feb. 6th, 2022 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: spent roughly 3 hours maxing out all of my CS knowledge stats in Learn to Code RPG by freeCodeCamp! step 1 of the 2022 Become-a-Dev New Year's Challenge, complete!

**Thoughts:** lol. i've been knocking the 30 minute rule out of the ballpark these past few days! often at the expense of another habit, but this is my main habit that i've chosen to implement. i had a fun time unlocking achievements, taking time to re-read what i first read several months ago in nov or dec 2021.... i had a much harder time getting a job in the game and began to have a good idea of how arduous and time-consuming the process was. i was surrounded by really kind and helpful people and the overall tone of the game was very encouraging and grounding. i have a better understanding now of git, linux, javascript, and sql. i also appreciated how difficult the "technical interview" questions were compared to my studies. and that the game will let you get accepted if your stats are above a certain threshold. unlocking different achievements and endings was also really fun too. it really stimulated the competitive and goal/achievement-oriented side of myself. it's funny how hard i went at this considering how i was encouraging myself to take it easy a few days ago. i felt really embarrassed about myself last night, had trouble sleeping, and just felt motivated to prove or compensate in some way. at least i achieved a goal i'd set out to do. 

### Day 5: Feb. 9th, 2022 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: took two days as a break to adjust to onboarding at a new job. these days were spent with me reading through game dev notes on Learn to Code RPG from freeCodeCamp in my spare time and starting to download the necessary software needed for the Relational Database Curriculum (also from fCC).

**Thoughts:** I feel a little bit over my head.... I'm not entirely sure what languages like Bash are for, even after maxing out my states in the coding RPG. but that's what the Internet is for, amirite?

### Day 6: Feb. 10th, 2022 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: spent about an hour or so finishing the set up of the aforementioned software on my main computer and Surface before finally starting the tutorial. 

**Thoughts:** Let me tell you, it was a RIDE trying to set the curriculum up these past few days! Having to use the git CMD terminal, remembering how to operate said terminal (when it was sort of assumed in the instructions), getting my Visual Studio Code to recognize that I've configured my Git account on my Git software by restarting the software... not getting it to work then... and then restarting the whole computer, which made it work. Lots of googling, asking my developer dad for help, and getting frustrated lol. Is this the software developing experience? Meanwhile, the actual tutorial itself was much more straightforward. Learned about Bash, Git (cursory level), JSON, Docker, and terminals. Feeling a little in over my head right now, but that's okay.
